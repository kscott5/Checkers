# Auto-download missing packages with Gradle
#
# When you run a build from the command line, or when using Android Studio 3.3 or later, 
# Gradle can automatically download missing SDK packages that a project depends on, as long as 
# the corresponding SDK license agreements have already been accepted using the SDK Manager.
#
# When you accept the license agreements using the SDK Manager, Android Studio creates a licenses 
# directory inside the SDK home directory. This licenses directory is necessary for Gradle to 
# auto-download missing packages.
